# Credit-Card-Lead-Prediction-Model
Hello all ðŸ˜Š, 

This is one of my personal projects in my Data Science journey and the data source:- https://www.kaggle.com/sajidhussain3/jobathon-may-2021-credit-card-lead-prediction?select=train.csv and conducted this as a job a thon by Analytics Vidya during May 2021.- https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/job-a-thon-2/#MySubmissions

I build a classification model to predict whether a customer is a lead or no using Gradient Boost algorithm with train accuracy as 0.8211431685409529 and validation accuracy as 0.8117780959070984.

After building the model, first I deployed it in my local system using flask framework and now deployed in Heroku a PaaS.
